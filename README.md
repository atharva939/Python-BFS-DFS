# Python-BFS-DFS
An interactive grid visualizer to demonstrate Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms in Python.
Pathfinding Visualizer

A Python application for visualizing pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on a grid.
Features

Interactive Grid: Create a grid with customizable dimensions.
Draw Walls: Click and drag to add obstacles to the grid.
Start & End Nodes: Easily set the starting and ending points for the search.
Algorithm Visualization: Watch BFS and DFS in action as they explore the grid.
Path Reconstruction: Once found, the final path is highlighted for a clear visual result.

How to Run

Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python installed.
Install Pygame: If you don't have the pygame library, install it using pip:

pip install pygame

Run the Script: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the script:

python pathfinding_visualizer.py


Controls

Left Mouse Click: Set the start node (orange), then the end node (turquoise). After that, add walls (black).
Right Mouse Click: Reset a node to a blank space.
Press B: Run the BFS algorithm.
Press D: Run the DFS algorithm.
Press C: Clear the entire grid.
